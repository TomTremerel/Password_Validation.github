# Validation Password
Hi there 👋

I start coding in january 2024 and this is my first project. It's a basic project using different features of JavaScript. 

The first idea was to create a validation form and put the text in red if the validation was not valid. ❓

Then I implemented the option of showing or not the password by puting a button. 🙈

You can directly see the result right there :
